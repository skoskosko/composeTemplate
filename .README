# Docker-Compose template for node.js back and nginx front
Meaby later with I will add some more features.


##mariadb
made with bitnami image with data linked to data folder.


##nginx
files folder has web root. ssl folder has template certs, and confs have configuration that overrides the defaults.
http://localhost/
https://localhost/


##node
There is 2 nodejs folders which have their own package.json and app.js file.
Port on both is 3333 so nginx proxy can listen them.


##proxy
Handles node access in port 3000
http://localhost:3000/general
http://localhost:3000/child1


##plans
Later i add some code samples to node, tomcat with jenkins. Meaby some more database connections. Or others stuff I find myself using and want to have template handy.
